- I love **creating technology that creates technology** (libraries, packages and more!) 🐱‍💻
- I enjoy developing for mobile (**with Flutter** 💙), but I do some web dev too :)
- 👩‍💻 I'm looking to contribute to open source, hoping to open some PRs soon! In the meantime, you can check out **my most recent open source package: [epub_decoder](https://pub.dev/packages/epub_decoder) for Flutter**.
- One of my current activities is doing research in AI applied to Automatic Short Answer Grading.
- I like to participate on hackathons and coding contests and, sometimes, win them (check out **my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofitoro/).** if you feel curious).
- In another life, 8 years ago, I used to be an artist 🎨.
